# Test Driven Development

**Expected time: 3hrs.**

* Re-do w1d1 Array exercises TDD.
    * That means writing specs alongside code.
    * **Don't use your old code**.
        * That wouldn't be TDD, right?
    * For Towers of Hanoi, focus on non-UI stuff first.
        * `#render`
        * `#move`
        * `#won?`
